Using deep learning GNN to detect APT attack

Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack detection and monitoring has attracted a lot of attention recently when this type of cyber-attacks is growing in both number and dangerous levels. The novelty and uniqueness of this method is the combination of many different data mining techniques in order to calculate, extract and represent the relationship and the correlation between APT attack behaviors based on Network traffic. In my model, many meaningful anomalous properties and behaviors of APT attacks are synthesized and extracted, which help improve the performance of APT attack detection. The experimental results showed that the proposed method is meaningful in both theory and practice since the my model not only improves the ability to correctly detect APT attacks in network traffic but also minimizes false alarms
